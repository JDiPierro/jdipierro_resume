#### [Syntaxic](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/syntaxtic/cgjalgdhmbpaacnnejmodfinclbdgaci?hl=en)

This Chrome extension by [Andrew Matheny](https://github.com/ajmath) makes reading code so much nicer! I wanted a new feature in it so... [I added it!](https://github.com/ajmath/Syntaxtic/pull/62)

#### Hashicorp's [Terraform](https://terraform.io)

This contribution was one of my first forays into the Go programming language. I [added importability](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/13270) for some Google Cloud resources. 


#### [Gitlab](https://www.gitlab.com)

I'm a huge fan of Gitlab's platform and have submitted a few small minor UI and backend enhancements. Check out my commits [here](http://contributors.gitlab.com/contributors/justin-dipierro/commits)

#### [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) [Codegen](http://swagger.io/swagger-codegen/)

While generating a Java client library from a Swagger spec I ran into [an issue](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/214) with how it handled an endpoint returning a List. I knew nothing about Scala but dove in head first to debug [and resolve](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/pull/215) the issue.
