#### Languages

I'm currently most proficient in **Python** and **Ruby** but I'd have no problem jumping back into **Java** or **Groovy**. **Javascript** doesn't (entirely) scare me, and **Typescript** helps me sleep at night. I can find my way around **Go**, **C++**, and have even dug through a **Scala** codebase to fix a bug. And just for keywords: I do in fact know **HTML** and **CSS** (including preprocessors). 

#### Frameworks and Tools

When it comes to web frameworks I've worked with **Rails**, **Grails**, **Meteor**, and **Spring**. 

**SaltStack** is my favorite configuration management system. I've had over two years experience using Salt to manage deployments of between 100 and 1000 nodes. I've also written **Chef** cookbooks.
 
I've designed and implemented build pipelines in **Jenkins**, **Gitlab**, and **Bamboo**. Several of which included some level of **continuous integration** to one or more environments.

I favor **Debian** based distros of Linux and have deployed to **AWS** and **Google Cloud**. I can write **upstart** and **systemd** jobs and configure **nginx** or **haproxy** however you need. I like **Sensu** to keep an overseeing eye on the health of systems and **prometheus** for metric tracking.

With **Postgres**, **Cassandra**, and **MongoDB** experience under my belt I can help you scale out your database with or without **SQL** (The latter being **NoSQL** for you buzzword fans).

If you've got a problem, Yo I'll solve it!
