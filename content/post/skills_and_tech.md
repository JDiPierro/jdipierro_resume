#### Languages

I'm currently most proficient in **Python**, and **Ruby**. I have no problem jumping into **Java** and **Groovy**. **Javascript** doesn't (entirely) scare me, and **Typescript** helps me sleep at night. I can find my way around **Go**, **C++**, and have even dug through a **Scala** codebase to fix a bug. 

#### Frameworks and Tools

When it comes to web frameworks I've worked with **Rails**, **Grails**, **Meteor**, and **Spring**. 

**SaltStack** is my favorite configuration management system. I've had over two years experience using Salt to manage deployments of between 100 and 1000 systems. I've also written **Chef** cookbooks.
 
I've designed and implemented build pipelines in **Jenkins**, **Gitlab**, and **Bamboo**. Several of which included some level of **continuous integration** to one or more environments.
