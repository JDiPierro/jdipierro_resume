#### Languages

I'm currently most proficient in **Python** and **Golang** but I'd have no problem jumping back into **Ruby**, **Java**, or **Groovy**. **Javascript** doesn't (entirely) scare me but I prefer **Typescript**. I can find my way around **C++** and have even dug through a **Scala** codebase to fix a bug. And just for keywords: I do in fact know **HTML** and **CSS** (including preprocessors). 

#### Other Tools of the Trade

When it comes to web frameworks I've worked with **Rails**, **Grails**, **Meteor**, and **Spring**. 

I've fallen in love with **Docker** and have deployed to self-hosted **Kubernetes** with **Helm** as well as **Amazon ECS** with **CloudFormation**.

**SaltStack** is my favorite configuration management system. I've had over two years experience using Salt to manage deployments of between 100 and 1000 nodes. I've also written a few **Chef** cookbooks.
 
I've designed and implemented build pipelines in **Jenkins**, **Gitlab**, and **Bamboo**. Several of which included some level of **continuous integration** to one or more environments.

Most server I've worked with run **Debian** based distros of Linux but I've also worked with **CentOS**. I've deployed to **AWS** and **Google Cloud**. When available I love to use Datadog for monitoring, but I've also had peace of mind using **Sensu** for monitoring and **Prometheus** for metric tracking.

As a developer I've used **Redis**, **Postgres**, **MongoDB**, and **DynamoDB**. I've also managed all of the above and **Cassandra** as an SRE. I can help you scale out and optimize your database with or without **SQL** (The latter being **NoSQL** for you buzzword fans).

If you've got a problem, Yo I'll solve it!
